**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was the application of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting combined with function calling to enhance the accuracy of large language model (LLM) outputs. This approach allowed for a more structured and iterative analysis process, revealing its potential for improving misinformation detection and analysis. The integration of predictive models with generative AI outputs further highlighted the versatility of these techniques in solving real-world challenges.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
For Quarter 2, I would like to pursue an investigation into integrating real-time search engine embedding with the current system. This would involve enabling dynamic retrieval of the most up-to-date information during model analysis to refine the factuality assessment. Additionally, I plan to explore fine-tuning LLM models to better align with the specific requirements of misinformation detection, incorporating domain-specific datasets for enhanced contextual understanding.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
A key change I would make to the current approach is improving the balance between predictive model and generative AI outputs. Specifically, I would like to refine the scoring mechanism to more effectively harmonize insights from both models, ensuring that their unique strengths are fully utilized without overwhelming the final analysis. This might involve reevaluating how weights are assigned to each model's output or experimenting with new techniques for score aggregation.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
In addition to the methods already employed, I am interested in exploring techniques such as real-time search engine embedding and fine-tuning LLMs. These techniques could greatly enhance the system's adaptability and precision by incorporating real-time data and tailoring the model’s responses to the unique demands of misinformation analysis. The goal would be to create a more dynamic and context-aware system capable of handling evolving challenges in this domain.
